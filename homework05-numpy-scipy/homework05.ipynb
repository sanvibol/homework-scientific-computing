    "Draw a full circle: first define a resolution e.g. $N=50$. Then define coordinates $x$ and $y$ using `np.linspace()` and pass the resolution as parameter `num=N`. Use `np.meshgrid()` to define a grid `xx` and `yy`. Define a canvas of shape `(N, N)` using `np.zeros()`. Then use the circle formula $x^2 + y^2 < r^2$ to define all circle points on the grid (use $r=2$). Then use the boolean 2D expression to set the inside of the circle to 1. Finally plot the canvas using `imshow()`."

    "Calculate the number of colors used in the picture `numpy-meme.png` and the percentage of the color space (3 x 8bit, i.e. 256 values per color) used!\n",

    "**Instructions:** Load the image by using `plt.imread()`. This will return a three dimensional array (width, height and colors) with values between zero and one. Multiplying the array with 255 will restore the original 8bit values (integer values between 0 and 255). After multiplying by 255 use `image = image.astype(int)` to convert the image to integer type. Plot the `image` using `plt.imshow()` to see the image and guess the result. Check the shape of the array. One of the axes is of length three - this is the color axis (red, green and blue). We want to map all colors to unique integers. This can be done by defining `colors = red  + green * 256 + blue * 256**2`. This is a unique mapping between the triples `(red, green, blue)` and the integers `color` similar to decimal digits (three values between 0 and 9 e.g. `(3, 5, 1)` can be mapped to a three digit number `3 + 5 * 10 + 1 * 100 = 153`). Then use `np.unique()` to get an array with unique colors (in the mapped form as in `color`). This can be used to determine the number of unique colors in the image. This value can also be used to calculate the percentage of the color space used.\n",
